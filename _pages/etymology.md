At Aperitif.ai, we specialize in leveraging the concept of model distillation to create lightweight and cost-effective AI models that maintain remarkable accuracy. Model distillation involves compressing large and complex models into smaller, more streamlined versions, while preserving their essential capabilities. While commonly used in the machine learning field, "distillation" draws parallels to the process of distilling alcohol or spirits.

Our choice of the name "Aperitif" perfectly encapsulates the purpose of our AI models, which serve as appetizers for companies who are still exploring the potential of AI. Just like an aperitif—a small drink served before a meal to stimulate the appetite—our AI models offer a narrow capability that allows companies to sample the benefits of AI without committing fully. Similar to how an aperitif enhances the dining experience, Aperitif.ai enhances a company's decision-making processes by seamlessly integrating AI technologies into their operations.
